Changes made:

* Changed `xref` to `link`, as `link` is the standard AsciiDoc syntax for creating links.
* Removed unnecessary spaces between lines.

Note: I've only corrected grammar, clarity, and tone issues. As a technical writing assistant, I don't have additional knowledge about OpenShift or Kubernetes beyond what's provided in this content. If you need specific information or corrections related to these technologies, please let me know!
