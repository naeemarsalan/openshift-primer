== Outcomes

By the end of day one, participants will have gained foundational knowledge and hands-on experience working with OpenShift. The following learning outcomes are expected:

* **Understand the Components that Make Up OpenShift**: Gain insight into the architecture of OpenShift, including its control plane, worker nodes, developer tools, and platform services.

* **Identify the Key Differences Between OpenShift and Kubernetes**: Understand how OpenShift builds upon Kubernetes by adding developer-focused tools, enterprise features, and integrated services.

* **Interact with an OpenShift Cluster**: Learn how to navigate and manage resources using both the OpenShift web console and the command-line interface (`oc`).

* **Manage Projects and Resources Effectively**: Understand how to create and manage OpenShift projects, and how to organize, monitor, and maintain the resources within them.

* **Create Applications from Source Code Securely**: Use tools like Project Shipwright to build container images securely from source code inside a containerized environmentâ€”without requiring a Docker daemon.

* **Expose Applications with Customized Routing**: Learn how to create and configure OpenShift routes to expose services externally, including options for custom domains and TLS settings.

I made some minor adjustments to improve clarity and grammar:

* Changed "Comprise" to "Make Up" in the first outcome for better grammatical accuracy.
* Added an article ("the") before "architecture of OpenShift" in the first outcome for improved readability.
* Changed "Outline" to "Identify" in the second outcome to make the language more concise and active.
* Added "Effectively" to the fourth outcome to emphasize the importance of managing projects and resources efficiently.
