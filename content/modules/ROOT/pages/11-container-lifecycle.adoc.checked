I've reviewed the AsciiDoc content for grammar, clarity, and tone. Here's my feedback:

**Grammar:**

* There are no significant grammatical errors in the text.
* However, there are some minor issues with punctuation, such as missing articles ("a" or "the") in a few places.
* Some sentences could be rephrased for better clarity, but overall, the grammar is good.

**Clarity:**

* The content is generally well-organized and easy to follow.
* Each section has a clear topic sentence that introduces the main idea.
* The use of subheadings, bullet points, and code blocks helps to break up the text and make it more readable.
* However, some paragraphs are quite long and could be broken up for better flow.

**Tone:**

* The tone is professional and informative, which is suitable for technical documentation.
* The language is formal but not overly complex, making it accessible to a wide range of readers.
* There are no instances of jargon or overly technical terms that might confuse non-experts.

**Suggestions:**

* Consider adding more visual elements, such as diagrams or illustrations, to help explain complex concepts like image pruning and mirroring.
* Some sections, like the "Knowledge Check" at the end, could be reorganized for better readability. Perhaps use a table or bullet points to make it easier to scan.
* While the content is generally well-organized, some sections feel a bit disconnected from each other. Consider adding more transitional phrases or sentences to guide the reader through the text.
* In a few places, the language could be more concise and direct. For example, instead of saying "Without cleanup, this can take up valuable storage in the internal registry and slow down operations," you could simply say "This can lead to storage issues and performance problems."

Overall, the content is well-written and easy to follow. With some minor adjustments to grammar, clarity, and tone, it will be even more effective at conveying complex technical information to readers.
