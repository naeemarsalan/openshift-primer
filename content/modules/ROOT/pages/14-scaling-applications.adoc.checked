Here's my review of the AsciiDoc content:

**Grammar:**

The content appears to be grammatically correct, with no major errors in sentence structure, verb tense, or subject-verb agreement.

**Clarity:**

The content is generally clear and easy to understand, with concise sentences and proper use of headings, lists, and code blocks. However, some sections could benefit from additional explanations or examples to help readers who are new to the topic. For example:

* The section on "Resources Involved (When Using KEDA with Prometheus)" could be broken down into smaller subtopics or provided with a diagram to illustrate the relationships between the resources.
* The concept of "feedback loops" in the autoscaling process could be explained in more detail.

**Tone:**

The tone is professional and informative, which is suitable for technical documentation. However, some sections may come across as slightly dry or dense, which could make it harder for readers to stay engaged. Consider adding more conversational language or anecdotes to break up the text and make it more enjoyable to read.

**Suggestions:**

* Consider breaking up long code blocks into smaller, more manageable chunks, with additional explanations or comments to help readers understand what each section is doing.
* Add more visual elements, such as diagrams, flowcharts, or images, to illustrate complex concepts or relationships between components.
* Provide more concrete examples or use cases for the Custom Metrics Autoscaler and KEDA, especially for readers who are new to these topics.
* Consider adding a summary or recap at the end of each section to reinforce key takeaways and help readers retain information.

Overall, the content is well-organized and provides valuable information on autoscaling in OpenShift. With some additional explanations, examples, and visual elements, it could be even more effective at engaging and educating readers.
