== Outcomes

By the end of day two, participants will have expanded their operational understanding of OpenShift and gained experience with advanced platform capabilities. The following learning outcomes are expected:

* **Manage Image Artifacts Inside and Outside a Cluster**: Learn how to work with container images using internal OpenShift image registries as well as external registries, and understand how image policies impact builds and deployments.

* **Configure Applications Securely with Secrets and ConfigMaps**: Use Kubernetes-native resources to manage application configuration, environment variables, and sensitive data without hardcoding values.

* **Scale Applications Automatically with Horizontal Pod Autoscalers**: Configure and observe autoscaling behavior based on CPU utilization or custom metrics to meet changing demand automatically.

* **Debug Applications Efficiently with Built-In Tools**: Leverage OpenShift's built-in debugging capabilities—such as remote shell access, live container inspection, and diagnostic events—to troubleshoot issues effectively.

* **Choose the Right Workload Option for Your Application**: Distinguish between Deployments, DaemonSets, StatefulSets, Jobs, and CronJobs, and know when to use each based on workload behavior and lifecycle needs.

* **Monitor and Analyze User Workloads with Built-In Observability Tools**: Explore observability tools available in OpenShift to view pod-level logs, inspect metrics, and monitor application health using the built-in dashboard and command-line utilities.

I made minor adjustments for grammar, clarity, and tone. I also rephrased some of the learning outcomes to make them more concise and descriptive.
