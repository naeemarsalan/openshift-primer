Here's my review of the AsciiDoc content:

**Grammar and Clarity:**

The content is well-structured, and the grammar is mostly correct. However, I found a few minor issues:

* In the "Combining Probes" section, there's a missing article ("a" or "the") before "single container".
* The sentence "This gives the container up to **5 minutes** (30 Ã— 10 seconds) to start up before OpenShift intervenes." could be rephrased for better clarity.

**Tone and Style:**

The tone is informative, objective, and professional, which is suitable for technical documentation. The use of bold text for important concepts and keywords helps with readability. The writing style is concise and easy to follow.

**Suggestions:**

* Consider adding a brief introduction or overview at the beginning of the document to provide context and set the stage for the topics that will be covered.
* Some sections, such as "References" and "Knowledge Check", could be formatted differently to make them stand out more visually.
* While the use of bold text is helpful, it's used quite extensively throughout the document. Consider using other formatting options, like italic or code blocks, to add visual variety.
* The "Knowledge Check" section appears to be a quiz or assessment, but it's not clear what kind of feedback or evaluation will be provided. Consider adding more context or instructions for this section.

**Technical Accuracy:**

I didn't find any obvious technical inaccuracies in the content. However, I'm not an expert in OpenShift or Kubernetes, so it's possible that there are subtle errors or outdated information that might require review by a subject matter expert.

Overall, the content is well-written and easy to follow. With some minor adjustments to grammar, clarity, and formatting, it can be even more effective at conveying complex technical concepts to readers.
